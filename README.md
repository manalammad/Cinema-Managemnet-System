# Cinema-Managemnet-System
This project is a simulation of a Cinema Management System implemented using SQL for database management. It includes functionalities for managing cinema operations such as employee management, room and seat allocation, food services, scheduling movie screenings, and handling customer reservations.

** Features

Employee Management: Manages employees across different roles (managers, assistants, janitorial staff, snack bar staff) and branches.
Room and Seat Management: Allocates cinema halls and seats across multiple branches and cities.
Food Services: Tracks food items available at the cinema, including prices, for each branch.
Scheduling: Manages scheduling of movie screenings, including dates, rooms, and shifts.
Customer Reservations: Handles customer reservations for movie screenings, including seat allocation and scheduling.
Functionality
Data Generation: Python scripts are used to generate mock data for employees, rooms, seats, food items, shifts, scheduling, employee shifts, and customer reservations.

Database Insertion: SQL queries generated by the Python scripts insert the generated data into a relational database, mimicking a real-world scenario.
